features_percent_miss(data, percent_miss = 0, na_list = NULL)

\method{plot}{features_percent_miss}(x, add.label = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame or tibble or something that could become one}

\item{percent_miss}{numeric between 0 an 1 will filter out any columns that are missing more than this value}

\item{na_list}{list of elements to allow SumNa to think of as NA}

\item{x}{An object of class 'features_percent_miss' returned by the
\code{\link{features_percent_miss}} function.}

\item{add.label}{logical add percent labels to graph, defaults to TRUE}
}
\value{
a tibble (data frame) with columns: feature, SumNa (sum of NA entries), SumComp, PctNa, PctComp

A ggplot object representing the bar plot.
}
\description{
